## Getting Started

Install this starter (assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter
npm run serve
```

Alternatively:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter YourProjectName # Clone the project
cd YourProjectname
rm -rf .git # So you can have your own changes soter in VCS.
npm install # or yarn
npm run serve
```

## Configuration

 Edit `config.toml`

 ```toml
siteTitle="Gatsby Material Starter" # Site title
linkPrefix = "/"  # Gatsby link prefix
googleAnalyticsID = '' # GA id
disqusShortname = '' # Disqus shortname

postDefaultCategoryID= '12121212' # Disqus category for posts without categories.
userName = "Material User" # Your public name
userLocation = "Yerevan, Armenia" # Your location
userAvatar = "https://api.adorable.io/avatars/150/test.png" # Your avatar
userDescription = "Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven't seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people." # Your short "about me"

# An array of links to you projects/social profiles you want to share
# FORMAT: ['LABEL', 'LINK', 'ICON CLASSNAME']
# ICON CLASSNAME can be either FontAwesome or Material Design icon classnames.
userLinks = [
     ['Website', '//mywebsite.example.local', 'fa fa-link'],
     ['GitHub', '//github.com.local/USER', 'fa fa-github'],
     ['Twitter', '//twitter.local/USER', 'fa fa-twitter'],
     ['Instagram', '//instagram.local/USER', 'fa fa-instagram'],
     ['Facebook', '//facebook.com.local/USER', 'fa fa-facebook'],
     ['Email', 'mailto:gmail.com.local/USER', 'fa fa-envelope'],
]

copyright = "Copyright Â© 2017. Material User" # Footer copyright
 ```

 NOTE: All configuration variables except for `siteTitle` are optional and won't render if omitted.

## Theming

Edit `pages/theme.scss` to suit your needs.
You can use [Material color palette](https://react-md.mlaursen.com/customization/colors) provided by React-MD.

```css
@import '~react-md/src/scss/react-md';
$md-primary-color: $md-deep-orange-500;
$md-secondary-color: $md-red-400;
$md-tertiary-color: $md-grey-300;
```

## Roadmap

* Tag pages support. (*)
* Category pages support. (*)
* Social sharing component.
* Search.

Items denoted with `*` are possibly halted until Gatsby 1.0 release with dynamic routing support.
