## Getting Started

Install this starter (assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter
npm run serve
```

Alternatively:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter YourProjectName # Clone the project
cd YourProjectname
rm -rf .git # So you can have your own changes stored in VCS.
npm install # or yarn
npm run serve
```

## Configuration

 Edit the export object in `data/SiteConfig`:

 ```js
module.exports = {
  siteTitle: 'Gatsby Material Starter', // Site title.
  pathPrefix: '/gatsby-material-starter', // Prefixes all links. For cases when deployed to example.github.io/gatsby-material-starter/.
  disqusShortname: 'https-vagr9k-github-io-gatsby-material-starter', // Disqus shortname.
  postDefaultCategoryID: 'Tech', // Default category for posts.
  userName: 'Material User', // Username to display in the author segment.
  userLocation: 'Yerevan, Armenia', // User location to display in the author segment.
  userAvatar: 'https://api.adorable.io/avatars/150/test.png', // User avatar to display in the author segment.
  userDescription: "Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven't seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people.", // User description to display in the author segment.
  // Links to social profiles/projects you want to display in the author segment/navigation bar.
  userLinks: [
    {
      label: 'Website',
      url: '//mywebsite.example.local',
      iconClassName: 'fa fa-link',
    },
    {
      label: 'GitHub',
      url: '//github.com.local/USER',
      iconClassName: 'fa fa-github',
    },
    {
      label: 'Twitter',
      url: '//twitter.local/USER',
      iconClassName: 'fa fa-twitter',
    },
    {
      label: 'Instagram',
      url: '//instagram.local/USER',
      iconClassName: 'fa fa-instagram',
    },
    {
      label: 'Facebook',
      url: '//facebook.com.local/USER',
      iconClassName: 'fa fa-facebook',
    },
    {
      label: 'Enail',
      url: 'mailto:gmail.com.local/USER',
      iconClassName: 'fa fa-envelope',
    },
  ],
  copyright: 'Copyright Â© 2017. Material User', // Copyright string in the footer of the website.

};
 ```

 You can also optionally set `pathPrefix`:
 ```js
 module.exports = {
  // Note: it must *not* have a trailing slash.
       pathPrefix: '/gatsby-material-starter', // Prefixes all links. For cases when deployed to example.github.io/gatsby-material-starter/.
}

 ```

 NOTE: All configuration variables except for `siteTitle` are optional and won't render if omitted.

## Theming

Edit `src/pages/theme.scss` to suit your needs.
You can use [Material color palette](https://react-md.mlaursen.com/customization/colors) provided by React-MD.

```css
@import '~react-md/src/scss/react-md';
$md-primary-color: $md-deep-orange-500;
$md-secondary-color: $md-red-400;
$md-tertiary-color: $md-grey-300;
```
